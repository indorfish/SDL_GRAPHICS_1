HOW TO INITIALIZE A BASIC SDL PROGRAM
=================================================

You need the SDL_Init( ... ) and SDL_Quit() functions, both found in the SDL.h library.
A prototypical SDL program with proper initialization and shutdown should look like this:

C CODE:

	#include <SDL2/SDL.h>
	#define INIT_FLAG SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING

	int main(void)
	{
		SDL_Init( INIT_FLAG );
		/* do stuff */
		SDL_Quit();

		return (0);
	}

For some reason, compiling SDL programs is not that straightforward. You gotta perform some linker wizardry for things to work out.

The flags are...
	SDL_INIT_TIMER
	SDL_INIT_VIDEO
	SDL_INIT_AUDIO
	SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK
	SDL_INIT_HAPTIC
	SDL_INIT_EVENTS
	SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER
	SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING
	SDL_INIT_NOPARACHUTE
These are Uint32 types, which just means typedef unsigned int Uint32.
They can be OR'ed together.

Will write more on these later, when I'm ready to be an expert. For now, just use INIT_EVERYTHING.

More functions for initialization and shutdown:

	SDL_InitSubSystem(...)
	SDL_QuitSubSystem(...)
	SDL_WasInit(...)
